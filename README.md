*Predictive Analytics for Restaurants*

**Project Scope**

The restaurant industry operates with notoriously thin operating margins, typically dropping around 5% of total revenue to their bottom lines. For every $1.00 in sales, approximately $0.30 - $0.35 will likely go to cost of goods while an additional $0.30 - $0.35 will go to labor, leaving roughly $0.30 - $0.40 to cover overhead (rent, insurance, utilities, equipment rentals, waste management, accounting, marketing) and provide a return on capital, to the extent there is any excess after covering all the costs.

An accurate sales forecast provides several avenues of cost saving + revenue expansion to restaurants:

* **Labor Optimization** | Minimize labor hours on slow nights while maintaining appropriate staffing levels on busier nights.
* **Minimize Food Waste** | More precise daily prep levels to help limit food waste.
* **Lean Inventory** | Inventory is a drag on cash flow and high levels of inventory of fresh goods can lead to spoilage and food waste.
* **Marketing Iniatives** | Maximize marketing dollars by targeting slow nights and weeks.

Using real sales data from a two-star restaurant located in Brooklyn, NY, this is a pilot project exploring what an end-to-end restaurant sales forecasting tool utilizing machine learning would entail.
